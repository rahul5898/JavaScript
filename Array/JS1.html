    <p>Q.1 Peak an element

        An element is called a peak element if its value is not smaller than the value of its adjacent elements(if they
        exists).
        Given an array arr[] of size N, find the index of any one of its peak elements.
        Note: The generated output will always be 1 if the index that you return is correct. Otherwise output will be 0.

        Example 1:
        Input:
        N = 3
        arr[] = {1,2,3}
        Output: 1
        Explanation: index 2 is 3.
        It is the peak element as it is
        greater than its neighbour 2.</p>

        for(let i=0; i<element; i++){
            arr[i] = prompt("Enter "+(i+1)+" array element");
        }
        for(let i=0; i<element; i++){
            if (arr[i] >= arr[i - 1] && arr[i] >= arr[i + 1])
            document.write(arr[i]+" ");
        }
